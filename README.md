# SFML-MapMaker

General
--------------

- Project created with Visual Studio 2015 and SFML.
- SFML: http://www.sfml-dev.org/


Other:
--------------

- To run SFML with vs15, download appropiate <a href=http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=9513.0>vs15-Nightly Build</a> (recommended 32bit Version) and follow the offcicial <a href=http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.3/start-vc.php>SFML-Visual Studio Tutorial</a>
- You can use the uploaded *"MapMaker.sln"* file but have to adjust the Project-Properties (correct path to the .lib etc files from SFML, see tutorial)
- I've used the static-linking from SFML (no need to copy over the SFML-DLLs)
